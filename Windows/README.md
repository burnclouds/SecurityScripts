# CyberPatriot_Windows_Scripts

How to set up and use the scripts:

1. Ask Jackson for the self-extracting archive (a .exe file)

2. Copy the archive to the Desktop of the VM

3. Double-click it and click "Extract"

4. Open "Script\cmder" and right-click on Cmder.exe > Properties > Compatibility > Check "Run this program as an administrator"

5. Pin Cmder.exe to taskbar

6. Open cmder. There will be a prompt that guides you from there.

7. As you run the scripts, "progress.txt" on the desktop will update with the sections that you complete.

Pro-tip: Don't become dependent on the script. Know how to do everything manually because the script always breaks. Always.
